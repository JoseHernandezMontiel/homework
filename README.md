INSTRUCTIONS:

  In order to execute any project in this folder, you must first activate the python virtual environment. You can achieve that by entering the following command in your terminal:

  .\virtual_environment\Scripts\activate

  Once the virtual environment is activated, you can change the directory to any folder where you want to run a python program. Use the following command:

  cd {directoryName}
  python {pythonProgram}.py

  To deactivate the virtual environment, simply enter the following command (you can execute it from any location, but it must be executed in the same terminal where it was activated)

  deactivate
